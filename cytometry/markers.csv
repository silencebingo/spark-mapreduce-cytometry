,FSC-A,,,Forward Scatter (FSC)  A parameter measuring light scattered less than 10 degrees as a cell passes through the laser beam. The FSC measurement is related to cell size.
,SSC-A,,,Side Scatter (SSC)  Also called 90o scatter or right angle scatter. Light scattered at a 90 degree angle as a cell passes through the laser beam. This measurement is related to the internal granularity or complexity of a particle.
